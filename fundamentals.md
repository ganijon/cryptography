# Fundamentals of cryptography

## Encoding & Decoding
- makes it easier to store, transmit, read binary data
- textual representation of binary information
- provides no protection of information
- easily reversible process
- Examples: ASCII->Binary, Binary->Hex, Binary->Base64

## Encryption & Decryption
- protects confidentiality of information

### Symmetric cipher (Secret Key Cryptography)
  - substanially faster than asymmetric cipher
  - advantage of hardware acceleration
  - there are 2 groups:
    - Stream cipher: processes input 1 byte at a time
    - Block cipher:  processes input in fixed-length blocks

### Asymmetric ciper (Public Key Cryptogrpahy)
  - solves key distribution problem
  - Example: HTTPS 

## Hashing
- verifies integrity of information

## Correct usage
